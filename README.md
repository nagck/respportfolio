# Responsive Portfolio

## Description 

In this repository ("Responsive Portfolio"), I have created a sample website about my personal portfolio as part of my assignment for UofT SCS Coding Boot Camp Course. The sample portfolio website has been developed to demonstrate responsive design (using Bootstrap toolkit) which ensures that web sites/applications render well on a variety of devices and windows or screen sizes.

Users today access web sites/applications from a variety of devices with varying screen sizes. As web developers, it is our responsibility to ensure that all web sites/applications developed today incorporate responsive design for all components within the website (navigation bars, layouts, images, etc.). This will ensure that users get consistent user experience across all devices when they visit the website or use the web application.

This source code is available to everyone under the standard MIT license.

## Installation

Download the repo files as is and copy the files to a designated directory on your web server or computer without changing the directory/folder structure. 

## Usage 

The website can be accessed via any standard browser on any device supported by the browser.
